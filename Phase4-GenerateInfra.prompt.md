Generate Infrastructure as Code Files for Azure Deployment

Use `azure_development-summarize_topic` tool to get high-level instructions to follow.

Use `azure_recommend_service_config` to automatically detect services and dependencies from the migrated application.

Use `azure_check_region` to validate that required Azure services are available in the target region.

Use `azure_check_quota` to ensure sufficient quota for deployment.

Create an 'infra' directory in the modernized project folder if it doesn't already exist.

Create an azure.yaml file in the root of the modernized project for Azure Developer CLI (azd) support.

Use `azure_check_predeploy` to validate the generated infrastructure files.

Use managed identities for authentication instead of connection strings and keys.

Set up proper RBAC with least privilege principles.

Configure appropriate scaling settings based on the application requirements.

Set up proper networking and security configurations including private endpoints where applicable.

Configure cost optimization settings (auto-scaling, reserved instances where appropriate).

Set up monitoring, alerting, and log aggregation.

Include infrastructure testing and validation scripts.

If infrastructure generation fails, provide detailed error analysis and alternative approaches.

Make the infrastructure section in the migration report human-readable and in markdown format, using headings, bullet points, and other formatting options as appropriate.

Suggest that the next step is to validate the migrated code, and mention `/phase5-deploytoazure` is the command to start the code validation process.

At the end, update the status report file reports/Report-Status.md with the status of the assessment step, including:
  - Infrastructure components created
  - Security configurations implemented  
  - Monitoring and logging setup
  - Any issues encountered during generation

Set up proper monitoring with Application Insights and Log Analytics.

Configure Entra ID integration for authentication with proper RBAC.

Set up database resources if applicable (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, etc.) with private endpoints.

Include proper tagging and naming conventions using resource tokens.

Implement security best practices: managed identities, private endpoints, network restrictions.

Configure RBAC assignments for service-to-service authentication using managed identities.

Based on the chosen Azure hosting platform in the assessment report (App Service, AKS, or Container Apps), generate the appropriate infrastructure files:

## For Bicep Infrastructure:
- Use Azure Verified Modules (AVM) where available for best practices, https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules.
- Use `azure_bicep_schemas-get_bicep_resource_schema` tool for each resource type to ensure correct schema usage.
- Create the following structure in the 'infra' folder:
  - main.bicep - Main deployment file with proper targeting scope
  - main.parameters.json - Parameters for the deployment
  - modules/ - Folder for modular Bicep files
    - appService.bicep or containerApp.bicep or aks.bicep (depending on chosen platform)
    - monitoring.bicep - Application Insights and Log Analytics resources
    - database.bicep (if applicable) - Database resources with proper networking
    - identityAndSecurity.bicep - Managed Identity and RBAC setup
    - networking.bicep (if applicable) - VNet, NSG, private endpoints
    - keyvault.bicep - Azure Key Vault for secrets management
    - Key Vault must be configured with RBAC only (do not use access policies)
- Configure the infrastructure for the selected hosting platform:
  - For App Service: Set up App Service Plan, App Service, deployment slots, and related resources
  - For AKS: Set up AKS cluster, node pools, Azure Container Registry, and related resources
  - For Container Apps: Set up Container Apps Environment, Container Registry, and Container Apps

## For Terraform Infrastructure:
- Use `mcp_azure_mcp_azureterraformbestpractices` to retrieve current Terraform best practices for Azure.
- Create the following structure in the 'infra' folder:
  - main.tf - Main deployment file
  - variables.tf - Variable definitions
  - outputs.tf - Output definitions
  - providers.tf - Provider configuration
  - modules/ - Folder for modular Terraform files
    - app_service/ or container_app/ or aks/ (depending on chosen platform)
    - monitoring/ - Application Insights and Log Analytics resources
    - database/ (if applicable) - Database resources
    - identity/ - Managed Identity and RBAC setup
    - networking/ (if applicable) - VNet, NSG, etc.
- Configure the infrastructure for the selected hosting platform.
- Set up proper monitoring with Application Insights and Log Analytics.
- Configure Entra ID integration for authentication.
- Set up database resources if applicable (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, etc.).
- Include proper tagging and naming conventions.
- Prefer Managed Identity and OIDC federated credentials; avoid storing secrets in state or code.
