# GitHub Copilot Chatmodes & Prompts


This repository showcases how GitHub Copilot using custom prompts and chat mode can be leveraged to migrate solutions from various languages and frameworks to Azure. The current focus is on .NET and Java applications, demonstrating end-to-end migration journeys. The project now includes enhanced modernization tracking, status reporting, and a more structured approach to the migration process.

## Overview

The GitHub Copilot Migration & Modernization for Azure project provides a structured approach to:

1. Assess legacy applications for cloud readiness
2. Migrate code to modern frameworks
3. Generate Azure infrastructure as code
4. Validate code and infrastructure

5. Deploy applications to Azure
6. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

Through a guided, AI-assisted workflow, developers can efficiently transform legacy applications into modern, cloud-native solutions running on Azure.

## Requirements

- Azure MCP Server Extension
- GitHub Copilot for Azure Extension
- GitHub Copilot Extension 1.35+
- GitHub Copilot Chat Extension 0.30+
- Visual Studio code 1.101+
- AZD CLI
- AZ CLI
- Development tools that fit to your application

## Avoiding Hallucinations

To reduce hallucinations during the migration, the guided prompts use two files in the repository's `reports/` folder:

- `reports/Report-Status.md` — overall migration status dashboard
- `reports/Application-Assessment-Report.md` — application assessment summary

You can update these files at any phase to fit your requirements.

During each phase, read the summary carefully to understand what will be delivered by the model and what inputs are needed.

Pro tip: for the rewrite migration process, some unnecessary files may be created (Class1.cs); clean them up before your final check-in.
Pro tip2: use the @terminal command to ask the agent to solve issues during your tests.
Pro tip3: Don't assume anything, always verify with the documentation.

## Migration & Modernization Process

The repository implements a structured 6-phase approach to application migration:

### Phase 1: Plan Migration

Plan your migration by asking key questions about your migration project requirements, hosting preferences, and database needs to create a tailored migration strategy.

### Phase 2: Assessment

Generate a comprehensive report assessing the current application structure, dependencies, and architecture with detailed risk analysis and effort estimation.

### Phase 3: Code Migration

Upgrade application code to the latest framework versions compatible with Azure, with automated transformations and incremental validation.

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Generation

Create infrastructure as code (IaC) files (Bicep or Terraform) for deploying to Azure, incorporating best practices and security configurations.

### Phase 5: Deployment to Azure

Deploy the validated application to Azure services with comprehensive deployment monitoring and validation.

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Configure automated deployment pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, with environment-specific configurations and security gates.

- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**: Identification and mitigation strategies for potential migration issues
- **Deployment Monitoring**: Real-time validation and monitoring during application deployment
- **Incremental Validation**: Step-by-step validation throughout the migration process

## Migration Status Tracking

The project now includes comprehensive migration status tracking through the `/getstatus` command:

- **Progress Monitoring**: Track overall migration progress with completion percentages and phase status
- **Quality Metrics**: View quality scores for each completed phase
- **Timeline Tracking**: Timestamps for completed phases to monitor project timeline
- **Risk Management**: Identification and tracking of potential issues with severity levels
- **Next Steps Guidance**: Clear recommendations for the next steps in the migration process
- **Resource Links**: Quick access to relevant documentation and resources
- **Executive Summary**: At-a-glance view of key migration metrics and status

Status reports are stored in the `reports/Report-Status.md` file, providing a central location for tracking migration progress across all phases.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) in your Visual Studio Code
3. Open one of the use case projects in VS Code
4. Start a chat with GitHub Copilot using the prompt:  "`/phase1-planmigration` under the folder #file:02-NetFramework30-ASPNET-WEB" to begin the migration planning
5. Use `/getstatus` at any time to check the current migration status
6. Follow the guided prompts to complete each phase of the migration process

## Target Azure Hosting Platforms

The migration process supports multiple Azure hosting options:

- **Azure App Service**: For web applications and APIs
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For containerized applications
- **Azure Container Apps**: For microservices and containerized applications

## Authentication & Authorization

The repository includes support for migrating from various authentication systems to Azure Entra ID, ensuring secure access to modernized applications.
